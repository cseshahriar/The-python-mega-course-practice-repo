# The python mega course practice repository

Did you know The <strong>Python</strong> is mainly used for <strong>automation purposes</strong>, <strong>web apps</strong>, and <strong>data science</strong>. Many big companies, like Instagram, Facebook, and Amazon, use Python in different parts of their products. For example, <strong>Facebook</strong> uses Python to <strong>process images</strong>.

Did you know That <strong>Python</strong> was first released in 1991? <strong>Python 2</strong> was released in 2000, and Python 3 (the current version) in 2008.

Did you know The Python got his name not from the snake, but from <strong>Monty Python's Flying Circus</strong>, a favorite comedy series of <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong>, the <strong>creator of Python</strong>.

## The basics of Python

In this section, you learned that:
<br>

Integers are for representing whole numbers:
<pre>
rank = 10
eggs = 12
people = 3
</pre>
<br>

Floats represent continuous values:
<pre>
temperature = 10.2
rainfall = 5.98
elevation = 1031.88
</pre>
<br>

Strings represent any text:
<pre>
message = "Welcome to our online shop!"
name = "John"
serial = "R001991981SW"
</pre>
Lists represent arrays of values that may change during the course of the program:

<code>
members = ["Sim Soony", "Marry Roundknee", "Jack Corridor"]
pixel_values = [252, 251, 251, 253, 250, 248, 247]
</code>
<br>

Dictionaries represent pairs of keys and values:
<pre>
phone_numbers = {"John Smith": "+37682929928", "Marry Simpons": "+423998200919"}
volcano_elevations = {"Glacier Peak": 3213.9, "Rainer": 4392.1}
</pre>
<br>

Keys of a dictionary can be extracted with:
<pre>
phone_numbers.keys()
Values of a dictionary can be extracted with:
</code>

<code>
phone_numbers.values()
</code>
Tuples represent arrays of values that are not to be changed during the course of the program:

<pre>
vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
one_digits = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
To find out what attributes a type has:
</pre>

<code>
dir(str)
dir(list)
dir(dict)
  
 help(list)
 help(list.values)
</pre>
To find out what Python builtin functions there are:

<pre>
dir(__builtins__)
</pre>
Documentation for a Python command can be found with:

<pre>
help(str)
help(str.replace)
help(dict.values)
</pre>
