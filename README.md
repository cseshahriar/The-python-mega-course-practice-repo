### Python is mainly used for automation purposes, web apps, and data science. Many big companies, like Instagram, Facebook, and Amazon, use Python in different parts of their products. For example, Facebook uses Python to process images.

### Did you know that Python was first released in 1991? Python 2 was released in 2000, and Python 3 (the current version) in 2008.

### Python got his name not from the snake, but from Monty Python's Flying Circus, a favorite comedy series of Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python.

# The basics of Python

In this section, you learned that:

Integers are for representing whole numbers:

rank = 10
eggs = 12
people = 3
Floats represent continuous values:

temperature = 10.2
rainfall = 5.98
elevation = 1031.88
Strings represent any text:

message = "Welcome to our online shop!"
name = "John"
serial = "R001991981SW"
Lists represent arrays of values that may change during the course of the program:

members = ["Sim Soony", "Marry Roundknee", "Jack Corridor"]
pixel_values = [252, 251, 251, 253, 250, 248, 247]
Dictionaries represent pairs of keys and values:

phone_numbers = {"John Smith": "+37682929928", "Marry Simpons": "+423998200919"}
volcano_elevations = {"Glacier Peak": 3213.9, "Rainer": 4392.1}
Keys of a dictionary can be extracted with:

phone_numbers.keys()
Values of a dictionary can be extracted with:

phone_numbers.values()
Tuples represent arrays of values that are not to be changed during the course of the program:

vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
one_digits = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
To find out what attributes a type has:

dir(str)
dir(list)
dir(dict)
To find out what Python builtin functions there are:

dir(**builtins**)
Documentation for a Python command can be found with:

help(str)
help(str.replace)
help(dict.values)
